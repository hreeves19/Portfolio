# Portfolio - Court Reeves
***
This is my portfolio and an example website of what I am capable of as an individual and a web developer! This application
is based off of the MEAN Stack, which is developed using MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed to run this application
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) on your machine or hosted in the cloud

## Running this Application
***
Clone or download the zip file of the repository. I highly recommend the text editor [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), which is what I use on a daily basis!

### Setting Up the Server
1. Navigate to where you have the repository stored at on your machine, open up **git bash** or any terminal of your choice
2. We need to first install all the dependincies for this project, which is why we must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Run the command: `npm install`
3. Once the modules have been installed, you'll need to copy the contents of the file **.env.dist** into a new file called **.env**. This file contains all the environment variables that the server needs to run to your configuration, such as connecting to your MongoDB.
4. After setting up your environment variables, all you need to do now is run `npm run server` and you should now be able to hit the server with your own API requests!
